# Dust concentration trends in different land use types 
This repository uses mean monthly dust concentration to compute the fraction dust concentration per land use type across coccidiomycosis endemic regions in California.

## Data 
- Monthly dust concentration: This dataset was produced from a combined geoscience-statistical method outlined in van Donkelaar et al. (2019) and is made [publicly available on Box](https://wustl.app.box.com/s/wk3144jc6xfy6ujfvyv5m2yfk33nz2nn/folder/136086352053) from Washington University in St. Louis. 
- Yearly land use maps: We use the Cropland Data Layers (CropScape) as our source of yearly land use types. This dataset was downloaded from https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/. When performing the data download, the CropScape data was subsetted to the state of California and projected to a lat/lon (WGS83) grid using the tools on the user interface.
