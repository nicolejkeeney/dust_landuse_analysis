# Dust concentration trends in different land use types 
This repository uses mean monthly dust concentration produced from a combined geoscience-statistical method outlined in van Donkelaar et al. (2019). This dataset made [publicly available on Box](https://wustl.app.box.com/s/wk3144jc6xfy6ujfvyv5m2yfk33nz2nn/folder/136086352053) from Washington University in St. Louis. Yearly land use maps for the state of California are derived from the Cropland Data Layers (CropScape) and were downloaded from https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/. When performing the data download, the CropScape data was subsetted to the state of California and projected to a lat/lon (WGS83) grid using the tools on the user interface.
